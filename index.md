# Pathetic Exchange Tracker

## Introduction

There is a huge effort underway to discourage bitcoiners from using bitcoin privately, specifically discouraging the use of CoinJoin software. 

This is a coordinated effort which involves many large exchanges, analytics companies and sell out bitcoiners.

Don't be coerced into giving up your privacy - KEEP USING COINJOIN.

## Pathetic Exchanges

All the exchanges in the table below have flagged coinjoin use and should be avoided. 

Details are provided where known (e.g. whether flagging occured at deposit/withdrawal & which coinjoin tool was used).

Sources provided where publicly availible. Exchanges without sources are verified privately.

## CoinJoin

Bitcoin transactions are public.
Used na√Øvely this makes bitcoin transactions very easy to follow, meaning that bitcoin is not private by default.
Used carefully (with the correct tools) bitcoin can be used quite privately.
One key tool used by those looking to use bitcoin more privately is CoinJoin.
The best coinjoin tool currently availible is whirlpool which is availible in [Sparrow](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/) or on [Samourai Wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/) connected to your own node.

## Options for Users

Regardless of which of the below options you choose you should never leave a balance on an exchange.

Option 1. CoinJoin & Avoid Pathetic Exchanges

Exchanges which require KYC documentation are security holes and have been hacked time and time again.
Buy with [non KYC](https://bitcoiner.guide/nokyconly/) e.g. [bisq](https://bisq.network/) or [earn](https://bitcoinerjobs.co/) bitcoin directly. 

Option 2. CoinJoin & Continue using Exchanges

This is an option which many will take due to the convenience of KYC exchanges (particularly those who have been 'verified').
Users attempting this risk having their accounts locked for breaking (potentially unwritten) rules..

Typically users doing this attempt to put distance between the exchange and their mixed coins by sending through multiple intermediate addresses, this can be done easily with [ricochet](https://www.samouraiwallet.com/ricochet).

Option 3. Stop CoinJoining

This is the worst option.
It's not normal for companies to undergo pervasive and indefinite surveillance on paying customers. 
If you comply you are complicit. **Push back.**

## Pay With CoinJoin

Regardless of your decision above, consider paying with mixed coins when spending your bitcoin.
If people pay with mixed coins for normal 'legitimate' goods and services the heuristic that mixed coins are suspicious is broken.
Even better, the merchant you shop at has coins 1 step removed from a CoinJoin tx, analytics companies / exchanges won't be able to ban these users who have no way to selectively accept payments.
